    You were with your friends partying
    When the alcohol kicked in
    Said you wanted me dead
    So, you show up at my home, all alone
    With a shovel and a rose
    Do you think I'm a joke?
  </p>
  <p>
    'Cause people like you always want back what they can't have
    But I'm past that and you know that
    So you should turn back to your outback tellin' them trash
  </p>
  <p>
    Tell all of your friends that I'm crazy and drive you mad
    That I'm such a stalker, a watcher, a psychopath
    Then tell them you hate me and dated me just for laughs
    So, why do you call me and tell me you want me back?
    You maniac
  </p>
  <p>
    You maniac
    (Maniac, some may say that I'm) You maniac
    (Maniac, some may say that I'm) You maniac
    (Maniac, some may say that I'm)
  </p>
  <p>
    You just went too far
    At your car, called me crying in the dark
    Now you're breaking my heart
    So, I show up at your place right away
    Wipe the tears off of your face
    While you beg me to stay
  </p>
  <p>
    Well, people like you always want back what they can't have
    But I'm past that and you know that
    So you should turn back to your outback tellin' them trash

  <p>
    Psychopathic, don't be so dramatic
    We had magic, but you made it tragic
    Now you're manic, honestly I've had it
    Listen to yourself, think you need to get some help
  </p>
