  Comfort Crowd </a></u></strong></h3>

  <p>This hurt that I'm holding's getting heavy
  But I'ma keep a smile on my shoulders 'til I'm sweaty
  Beggin' on my knees
  Screamin', "Someone come and help me"
  But by the time they're there
  I've already hid the body</p>
  <p>My breath's gettin' short and I'm unsteady
  Wellin' up in tears as I lay upon your belly
  Telling you, "I'm fine I don't really need nobody"
  But you say through a sigh
  That I said that lie already</p>
  <p>I just needed company now
  Yeah, I just needed someone around
  Yeah, I don't care what song that we play
  Or mess that we make
  Just company now</p>
  <p>Comfort crowd
  Comfort crowd</p>
  <p>We rot, thinkin' lots about nothing
  Yeah, I could spend a lifetime
  Sitting here talkin'
  And even if I cry all over your body
  You don't really mind
  Say you like your shirt soggy</p>
  <p>Yeah, I just needed company now
  Yeah, I just needed someone around
  Yeah, I don't care what song that we play
  Or mess that we make
  Just company now</p>
  <p>Comfort crowd
  Comfort crowd
  We mess around
  And laugh too loud
  And make the sounds</p>
  <p>We try to hide when people are around
  By blood we're bound
  Through ups and downs
  Through smiles and pouts
  Comfort crowd
  You can always count</p>
  <p>Yeah, I just needed company now
  Yeah, I just needed someone around
  Yeah, I don't care what song that we play
  Or mess that we make
  Just company now
  Comfort crowd</p>
