  <p>This party's shit, wish we could dip
    Go anywhere but here
    Don't take a hit, don't kiss my lips
    And please don't drink more beer</p>
  <p>I'ma crawl outta the window now
    'Cause I don't like anyone around
    Kinda hope you're following me out
    But this is definitely not my crowd</p>
  <p>Nineteen but you act twenty-five now
    Knees weak, but you talk pretty proud, wow
    Ripped jeans and a cup that you just downed
    Take me where the music ain't too loud
    Trade drinks, but you don't even know her
    Save me 'till the party is over
    Kiss me in the seat of your Rover
    Real sweet, but I wish you were sober</p>
  <p>I wish you were sober
    (Wish you were so, wish you were so, wish you were sober)
    I wish you were sober</p>
  <p>Tripped down the road, walking home
    You kissed me at your door
    Pulling me close, begging me to stay over
    But I'm over this rollercoaster</p>
  <p>I'ma crawl outta the window now
    Getting good at saying, "gotta bounce"
    Honestly you always let me down
    And I know we're not just hanging out</p>
  <p>Nineteen but you act twenty-five now
    Knees weak, but you talk pretty proud, wow
    Ripped jeans and a cup that you just downed
    Take me where the music ain't too loud
    Trade drinks, but you don't even know her
    Save me 'till the party is over
    Kiss me in the seat of your Rover
    Real sweet, but I wish you were sober</p>
  <p>I wish you were sober
    (Wish you were so, wish you were so, wish you were sober)
    I wish you were sober</p>
  <p>I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish
    I wish you were sober
    I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish
    I wish you were sober</p>
  <p>Nineteen but you act twenty-five now
    Knees weak, but you talk pretty proud, wow
    Ripped jeans and a cup that you just downed
    Take me where the music ain't too loud
    Trade drinks, but you don't even know her
    Save me 'till the party is over
    Kiss me in the seat of your Rover
    Real sweet, but I wish you were sober</p>
